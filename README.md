# Advent of code 2017

Due to my previous repo imploding in some fantastic ways. Ive decided to move to a new repo for 2017.
You can find my 2019 repo [here](https://github.com/A-UNDERSCORE-D/adventofcode2019)

Solutions may be in various languages. Most likely go, but there may be python versions or solutions only in python.
